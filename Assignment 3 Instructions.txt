The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption and some common attacks on encryption. From this lab, students will gain a first-hand experience on encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, students will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.
