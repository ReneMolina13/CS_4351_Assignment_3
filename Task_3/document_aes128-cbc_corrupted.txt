Over the past 200 years, humankind has gradually¨ª;‘î9+-	¡â'"òëthe higily technological society we live in today. However, to achieve this, mankind has dominated over nature and turned it into a resource base to feed our societyâ€™s massive appetite for consumption including water, food, natural resources, and energy. As a result, the environment has been overworked, to the point that soon it may fail to provide us these things that we take for granted. As both an engineering major and as part of humankind, I find it important to point out the changes that need to be made in our society in order for future generations to share the same prosperity that we enjoy today. In this research paper, I examine several arguments made about Sustainable Development such as a critique of traditional development, different ideas of how Sustainable Development should take place, and examples of Sustainable Development in action. How can we as a society be able to fix the many problems we have created with our environment such as biodiversity loss, climate change, and accumulation of waste when many of these issues have already gotten out of hand? How can we learn to respect nature for its beauty and value it holds to other animals when we have reduced it to simply a natural resource base to benefit humans? How can the countries of the world learn to cooperate to solve this common goal when we have created a culture of competition and exploitation? These questions are critical when discussing the issue of Sustainable Development and what must be done to preserve the environment.
